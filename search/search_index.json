We do not provide the rigs we used to animate them with as it is a big inconveniece for us. For this reason you have to use an animation spoofer plugin.

You can find the configuration files for each gun in ReplicatedStorage &gt; ApolloShared &gt; Configuration, then after opening the configuration file for the gun you want there should be an animations table like so: <pre><code>Animations = {\n[\"Idle\"] = \"rbxassetid://13205434064\",\n[\"Aim\"] = \"rbxassetid://13205459462\",\n[\"Fire\"] = \"rbxassetid://13206191252\",\n[\"Reload\"] = \"rbxassetid://13206180576\",\n[\"Chamber\"] = \"rbxassetid://13206554377\",\n}\n</code></pre></p> <p>Simply take out the old IDs and place your new ones.</p> <p>Animation can be in formats such as:</p> <ul> <li>\"rbxassetid://13205434064\"</li> <li>13205434064</li> <li>\"13205434064\"</li> </ul> <p>Bug</p> <p>Sometimes there might be some issues using the gun system IN STUDIO, for example it not loading properly. This happens rarely but still happens due to the whitelist being unstable in studio. The gun system should work fine in game, however we have noted that it can start working after a few hours/days in studio. There is currently nothing we can do about this.</p>"},{"location":"started/#giving-guns","title":"Giving Guns","text":"<p>There is no set method to give guns, you may place them wherever, whenever and they will work when equipped.</p>"},{"location":"support/","title":"Support","text":"<p>Having issues or have a question that isn't answered here?
