1 - Make sure you have python installed other wise install from www.python.org
   - I personally use https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-394/

2 - Install dependencies
   - pip install mkdocs
   - pip install mkdocs-material

3 - Run Server.bat
   This file will automatically run the mkdocs server
   Also this file was made by vamato

NOTE:
   If Server.bat is closed, the website won't be hosted.

4 - Hop to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to check the website

Finally

5 - change the files in docs/ and it will automatically update in the website
